-- | This module implements a scanner for the Decaf language for
-- 6.035.  It uses the 'Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec' library for its
-- excellent parsing combinators, which allow regular expressions to
-- be written as first-class objects that, when executed, can
-- immediately bind the constituents of the matched strings to
-- functions to produce, for instance, 'Token' data.
--
-- An annoying complication with this scanner is that the 6.035
-- specification requires that /all/ errors be reported, but Parsec
-- fails at the first sign of an error.  To solve this, portions of
-- the scanner are of the type 'ErrorScanner', which is an
-- 'ExceptionT'-wrapped 'Scanner' type.  Errors are caught using
-- structures of the form @p \<\<|>> scanFail (Just c)@, where
-- @(\<\<|>>)@ is @(\<|>)@ lifted to the 'ErrorScanner', @p@ is some
-- 'ErrorScanner', and @c@ is a character.  The @(\<\<|>>)@ operator
-- short-circuits on 'Exception's, and 'scanFail' raises as an
-- exception a 'TokenError' with the offending character and possibly
-- the expected character.
--
-- Due to the limited way in which the Parsec library exposes it's
-- implementation, it is not possible to obtain the list of expected
-- characters from within the monad, so the 'scanFail' operator
-- necessarily loses this information.  So that we can use normal
-- Parsec error handling but still be able to meet the 6.035
-- specification, the 'scanFail' operator can be turned on and off
-- (where off means the operator evaluates to 'mzero').  This is
-- toggled using the 'compatMode' option.
--
-- We have 'TokenType' and 'Token' be instances of 'Show' for
-- reasonable Parsec error messages and instances of 'Show6035' for
-- meeting the 6.035 specification.
