{- Notes about the genesis of Hoopl7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hoopl7 has the following major chages

a) GMany has symmetric entry and exit
b) GMany closed-entry does not record a BlockId
c) GMany open-exit does not record a BlockId
d) The body of a GMany is called Body
e) A Body is just a list of blocks, not a map. I've argued
   elsewhere that this is consistent with (c)

A consequence is that Graph is no longer an instance of NonLocal,
but nevertheless I managed to keep the ARF and ARB signatures
nice and uniform.

This was made possible by

* FwdTransfer looks like this:
    type FwdTransfer n f
      = forall e x. n e x -> Fact e f -> Fact x f 
    type family   Fact x f :: *
    type instance Fact C f = FactBase f
    type instance Fact O f = f

  Note that the incoming fact is a Fact (not just 'f' as in Hoopl5,6).
  It's up to the *transfer function* to look up the appropriate fact
  in the FactBase for a closed-entry node.  Example:
	constProp (Label l) fb = lookupFact fb l
  That is how Hoopl can avoid having to know the block-id for the
  first node: it defers to the client.

  [Side note: that means the client must know about 
  bottom, in case the looupFact returns Nothing]

* Note also that FwdTransfer *returns* a Fact too;
  that is, the types in both directions are symmetrical.
  Previously we returned a [(BlockId,f)] but I could not see
  how to make everything line up if we do this.

  Indeed, the main shortcoming of Hoopl7 is that we are more
  or less forced into this uniform representation of the facts
  flowing into or out of a closed node/block/graph, whereas
  previously we had more flexibility.

  In exchange the code is neater, with fewer distinct types.
  And morally a FactBase is equivalent to [(BlockId,f)] and
  nearly equivalent to (BlockId -> f).

* I've realised that forwardBlockList and backwardBlockList
  both need (NonLocal n), and that goes everywhere.

* I renamed BlockId to Label

The forward and backward dataflow analyses now use postorder depth-first
order for faster convergence.

The forward and backward cases are not dual.  In the forward case, the
entry points are known, and one simply traverses the body blocks from
those points.  In the backward case, something is known about the exit
points, but this information is essentially useless, because we don't
actually have a dual graph (that is, one with edges reversed) to
compute with.  (Even if we did have a dual graph, it would not avail
us---a backward analysis must include reachable blocks that don't
reach the exit, as in a procedure that loops forever and has side
effects.)

Since in the general case, no information is available about entry
points, I have put in a horrible hack.  First, I assume that every
label defined but not used is an entry point.  Then, because an entry
point might also be a loop header, I add, in arbitrary order, all the
remaining "missing" blocks.  Needless to say, I am not pleased.  
I am not satisfied.  I am not Senator Morgan.

Wait! I believe that the Right Thing here is to require that anyone
wishing to analyze a graph closed at the entry provide a way of
determining the entry points, if any, of that graph.  This requirement
can apply equally to forward and backward analyses; I believe that
using the input FactBase to determine the entry points of a closed
graph is *also* a hack.

{- Note [Unreachable blocks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A block that is not in the domain of tfb_fbase is "currently unreachable".
A currently-unreachable block is not even analyzed.  Reason: consider 
constant prop and this graph, with entry point L1:
  L1: x:=3; goto L4
  L2: x:=4; goto L4
  L4: if x>3 goto L2 else goto L5
Here L2 is actually unreachable, but if we process it with bottom input fact,
we'll propagate (x=4) to L4, and nuke the otherwise-good rewriting of L4.

* If a currently-unreachable block is not analyzed, then its rewritten
  graph will not be accumulated in tfb_rg.  And that is good:
  unreachable blocks simply do not appear in the output.

* Note that clients must be careful to provide a fact (even if bottom)
  for each entry point. Otherwise useful blocks may be garbage collected.

* Note that updateFact must set the change-flag if a label goes from
  not-in-fbase to in-fbase, even if its fact is bottom.  In effect the
  real fact lattice is
       UNR
       bottom
       the points above bottom

* Even if the fact is going from UNR to bottom, we still call the
  client's fact_extend function because it might give the client
  some useful debugging information.

* All of this only applies for *forward* fixpoints.  For the backward
  case we must treat every block as reachable; it might finish with a
  'return', and therefore have no successors, for example.
