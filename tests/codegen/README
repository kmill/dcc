We have a "get_int" function in addition to the "get_int_035" which
doesn't print out "Enter Integer Value: ".  Enter the lib directory
and run make to build this library.

To make the system work on a mac, run "make" from inside the "maclib"
directory before running "test.sh".  This creates an object file
containing these two "get_int*" functions.

Then, just run ./test.sh, which will recursively find all "*.dcf"
files in the directory.
