\section {Overview}

The Purpose of this project was to extend the semantic checker
produced at the end of the last project to actually generate correct
x86 assembly code. 

Our Code Generator follows a four step process. The first step is to
translate the Hybrid AST and Symbol Table produced as the output of
the previous project into a Mid-Level IR that represents the code as a
graph of Basic Blocks. The second step is to translate the mid IR into
a Low-Level IR that translates the higher level instructions used in
the mid IR to low level assembly instructions. The low IR initially
makes use of a number of ``Symbolic Registers'', so the next step of
code generation is to use a basic Register Allocator to replace these
symbolic registers with real registers and memory locations. Finally,
the low IR with all symbolic registers allocated is translated
directly into assembly language. 

The rest of this document outlines each of these steps in detail. The
mid level IR is described in Section~\ref{sec:midir}. The low level IR
is described in Section~\ref{sec:lowir}. The register allocator is
described in Section~\ref{sec:regalloc}. The assembly generator is
described in Section~\ref{sec:assembly}. 

\section{Division of Work} 
\label{sec:division}

The work was divided as follows. Kyle Miller designed and wrote the
mid IR and the low IR and wrote all of the translation functions
between them. Kyle also implemented several optimizations. Alec
Thomson wrote an initial assembly template that provided some skeleton
code for eventual assembly generation. Alec also wrote the simple
register allocator. Patrick Hulin and Steven Valdez wrote the code to translate the
low ir directly into assembly code. Each member of the team spent a
considerable amount of time debugging the final product. 

\section{Assumptions about Spec} 
\label{sec:assumptions}

The following were assumptions we made about the Decaf spec while we
wrote the code generator: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The Array index expression is evaluated before the assignment expression. 
\item Binary operators are evaluated left to right. 
\item Method arguments are evaluated right to left. 
\end{itemize}

\section {Register Allocation}

The code makes use of a very simple register allocator to eliminate
all symbolic registers from the Low IR. It's behavior is very
simple. It
